# Curvetopia: A Journey into the World of Curves

## Overview
**Curvetopia** is an innovative project dedicated to the identification, regularization, and enhancement of 2D curves. It encompasses a wide range of operations, including curve regularization, symmetry detection, and the completion of fragmented curves. The project is particularly useful for converting hand-drawn or irregular shapes into mathematically regularized forms, suitable for various applications in digital art, design, and computational geometry.

## Project Objectives
Curvetopia aims to process 2D curves by:

- **Regularizing Curves:** Conforming curves to specific geometric shapes.
- **Detecting Symmetry:** Identifying symmetries within closed curves.
- **Completing Curves:** Filling in gaps in curves that are fragmented or partially occluded.

## Features

### Regularize Curves
This feature focuses on identifying and regularizing geometric shapes such as straight lines, circles, ellipses, rectangles, polygons, and star shapes within a given set of curves.

### Symmetry Detection
Curvetopia includes tools to detect reflection symmetries in closed shapes, enabling the identification and enhancement of symmetrical patterns in hand-drawn or complex shapes.

### Completing Incomplete Curves
The project offers algorithms to complete curves that have been fragmented or occluded, ensuring smoothness, regularity, and symmetry in the completed shapes.

## Installation
To run Curvetopia locally, follow these steps:
